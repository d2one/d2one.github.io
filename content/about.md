# key skills

I have 10 years of experience in commercial web development. I’ve progressed from a junior developer to the CTO of a product company. Currently, I’m responsible for the unit that deals with the CPA monetization model at Avito.

Areas I can assist with:

Building web application architecture
Developing backend systems in PHP/Go (services and their interaction, monitoring, metrics, fault tolerance)
Career development for backend developers, IPR, 1:1 mentoring
Development processes
FOT (Full Operational Time) and its optimization
I work closely with team leads and have extensive knowledge of their challenges and pain points.
